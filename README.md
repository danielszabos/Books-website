# Books-website
This ecommerce website consists of 3 pages. The homepage where the product is displayed for the end user. Once they select one, they are directed to the purchasing page where they are required to fill out their details. Once all the data is validated, it directs the end user to the success page where the website confirms the order and displays the last 4 digits of the card number. 
 The website is built using the box layout in CSS. It is fully responsive and is also interactive. The design of the website was already given beforehand and was awarded a 90 mark out of 100. The colour scheme was hand picked so that it matches the theme of the product. It uses HTML to create and structure the pages. Furthermore, it uses JavaScript to allow interactivity between the website and the end user. It validates data request, then outputs a response. 
 There have been no libraries used for this specific project. 
Implements:
-HTML5 (structure)
-CSS3 (flexbox)
-JavaScript (validation)
